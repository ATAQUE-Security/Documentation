# Data Collection and Protection Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) 

## Purpose

The purpose of this SOP is to establish a standardized process for collecting and protecting data during red team operations. This includes ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive information.

## Scope

This SOP applies to all red team members involved in data collection and protection during simulated cyberattack exercises. It covers procedures for safeguarding sensitive data obtained during these operations.

## Responsibilities
Red Team:

Responsible for collecting and protecting data obtained during the operation.
Ensure the data collected is handled securely and in accordance with legal and ethical standards.

**Prerequisites**

Ensure that the attack machine used is a secure and isolated environment.
Maintain up-to-date attack tools and software.
Follow proper procedures for data handling and protection.

##Data Collection##

**Identification:**

Monitor and capture data related to red team scope securely. All Data Collected will be refernced in the final reporting. Data will be deleted as policy from all machines post excercie 

**Classification**

Classify the collected data based on its sensitivity and potential impact.
Determine the appropriate handling and storage requirements for each classified data type.
Data Collection:

Collect relevant data from target systems, including logs, configuration files, and any files containing sensitive information.
Ensure data is collected in a forensically sound manner to preserve its integrity.

## Data Protection:

Encrypt sensitive data during transit and at rest using industry-standard encryption protocols.
Store collected data in secure and isolated environments, ensuring access is restricted to authorized personnel only.
Incident Investigation:

Analyze collected data to understand the scope and impact of the simulated attack.
Identify potential vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the target environment.
Document findings for future analysis and reporting.
Data Handling and Reporting:

Maintain a detailed log of data collection activities, including timestamps and methods used.
Ensure that all collected data is reported in accordance with the organization's reporting standards.
Protect the confidentiality of sensitive data, ensuring it is not disclosed inappropriately.
Data Protection and Retention

Data Retention:

Define data retention policies and adhere to them strictly.
Destroy any collected data that is no longer needed for analysis or reporting.
Data Destruction:

Use secure methods to delete or destroy data, rendering it unrecoverable.
Document the process of data destruction for audit purposes.
Incident Review and Improvement

Incident Review:

After completing the red team operation, conduct a thorough review of the data collection process.
Analyze any incidents or challenges encountered during data collection.
Lessons Learned:

Identify lessons learned and areas for improvement in data protection and collection procedures.
Action Items:

Implement action items to enhance the security posture of the organization based on the findings of the review.
